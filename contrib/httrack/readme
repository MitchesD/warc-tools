httrak2warc.sh
---------------

This script will help you to move existing HTTtack collections to WARC format.
It's a 3 stags application:

1. collect all files within a collection
2. strip out unwanted ones (junk files, HTTRack related files ...)
3. proceeds to the conversion 

This script use the Python command "app/python/file2warc.py" internally.

So, change it to fit your needs.


WARC plugin for HTTrack
------------------------

To be able to use the WARC format as the backend storage system
for HTTrack, make sure you have HTTrack version 3.42.x or above correctly
installed:

$ httrack --version
HTTrack version 3.42-3+libhtsjava.so.2

If no, the simplest way is to build it from source:

$ wget http://www.httrack.com/httrack-3.42-3.tar.gz
$ tar xf httrack-3.42-3.tar.gz
$ cd httrack-3.42-3
$ ./configure your_options_here && make && sudo make install


Note: if you're running Debian/Ubunto or Redhat/Fedora, don't forget
the install HTTrack development headers.


When done, simply run:

$ make httrack

Note: if the "make" fail, make sure you've the HTTrack headers (*.h) inthe right directory "/usr/include/httrack".


And list the generated shard library:

$ ls -la contrib/httrack

You can now run HTTrack with WARC as storage backend:

$ httrack --wrapper contrib/httrack/httrack_warc.so



If you need to change something that doesn't fit, hack the module:
contrib/httrack/httrack_warc_plugin.c
