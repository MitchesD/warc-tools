This script will help you to move existing HTTtack collections to WARC format.
It's a 3 stags application:

2. strip out unwanted ones (junk files, HTTRack related files ...)
3. proceeds to the conversion 

This script use the Python command "app/python/file2warc.py" internally.

So, change it to fit your needs.
