WARC-tools interface to libCurl:

Requirements
-------------

* Please, make sure you have "libCurl" version 7.18.2 or above correctly 
installed from:
http://curl.haxx.se/download.html

If not:

$ ./configure --help
$ ./configure your_options && make && sudo make install

* Install the latest version of PycURL:
http://pycurl.sourceforge.net

$ cd pycurl-7.18.2
$ sudo python setup.py install

Features
---------

* it's very fast because it's almost all in C.
* it supports lots of extreme features like SSL-ed, tftp, ftp, telnet, dict, ldap, http, file, https, ftps and gopher.
* it provides a simple, clean way to write WARC files

A power mix between libCurl, Python, and warc-tools.



Usage
------

Don't forget to build the python interface first:

$ (cd ../.. && make && make python)

Then, run:
$ ./url2warc.py -h

And try the example:

$ ./url2warc.py -f list.txt -o foo.warc.gz
$ ls -la foo.warc.gz
